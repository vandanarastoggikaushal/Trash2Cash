# Migration Complete: Next.js → PHP Static Site

## Summary
Successfully migrated Trash2Cash NZ from Next.js/React to a pure PHP static site for Hostinger web hosting.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created PHP Structure
- ✅ Created `includes/header.php` - Shared site header with navigation
- ✅ Created `includes/footer.php` - Shared site footer
- ✅ Created `includes/config.php` - Configuration constants (rewards, company info, etc.)

### 2. Converted All Pages to PHP
- ✅ `index.php` - Homepage with hero, features, and rewards calculator
- ✅ `how-it-works.php` - How it works page
- ✅ `rewards.php` - Rewards information page
- ✅ `faq.php` - FAQ page
- ✅ `partners.php` - Partners page
- ✅ `contact.php` - Contact form
- ✅ `schedule-pickup.php` - Pickup scheduling form
- ✅ `terms.php` - Terms and conditions
- ✅ `privacy.php` - Privacy policy

### 3. Converted JavaScript Components
- ✅ `assets/main.js` - Rewards calculator (vanilla JavaScript)
- ✅ `assets/contact.js` - Contact form handler
- ✅ `assets/schedule-pickup.js` - Pickup form handler with validation

### 4. Styling
- ✅ Using Tailwind CSS via CDN (configured in header)
- ✅ Custom styles in `assets/styles.css`

### 5. API Endpoints (Already Existed)
- ✅ `api/lead.php` - Handles pickup lead submissions
- ✅ `api/contact.php` - Handles contact form submissions

### 6. Configuration
- ✅ `.htaccess` - Apache configuration for clean URLs
- ✅ `README-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide

## Files That Can Be Removed (No Longer Needed)

### Next.js Files
- `next.config.mjs`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `package.json` (unless you want to keep build tools)
- `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### Next.js Directories
- `app/` - All Next.js pages (replaced with PHP files)
- `components/` - React components (converted to PHP/HTML)
- `lib/` - TypeScript utilities (converted to JavaScript)
- `types/` - TypeScript types (not needed for PHP)
- `tests/` - Vitest tests (can keep for reference or remove)
- `config/` - TypeScript config (converted to PHP config)

### Other Files to Consider
- Root-level `index.html` files (if they exist and are outdated)
- `public/` directory content (if not using it for assets)

## Files to Keep

### PHP Files
- All `.php` files in root
- `includes/` directory
- `api/` directory

### Assets
- `assets/` directory (CSS, JS)
- `data/` directory (for JSON storage)

### Configuration
- `.htaccess`
- `README-DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md` (this file)

## Migration Checklist

### Before Deploying
- [ ] Test all forms locally or on staging
- [ ] Verify data directory permissions
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Check navigation links
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test rewards calculator

### After Deploying
- [ ] Test contact form submission
- [ ] Test pickup form submission
- [ ] Verify JSON files are created in `data/` directory
- [ ] Check all page links work
- [ ] Verify clean URLs work (remove .php extension)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Key Differences from Next.js Version

1. **No Build Process**: Static PHP files, no compilation needed
2. **Server-Side Includes**: Using PHP `require_once` for header/footer
3. **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS instead of React
4. **Styling**: Tailwind via CDN instead of compiled CSS
5. **Forms**: Direct PHP endpoints instead of Next.js API routes
6. **Data Storage**: JSON files instead of database (can add DB later if needed)

## Next Steps

1. **Email Integration**: Currently emails are logged. Add actual email sending:
   - Edit `api/lead.php` and `api/contact.php`
   - Add PHP `mail()` or PHPMailer

2. **Admin Panel**: Consider creating an admin panel to view submissions:
   - Create `admin/` directory
   - Protect with authentication
   - View `data/leads.json` and `data/messages.json`

3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to API endpoints to prevent spam

4. **Data Backup**: Set up automatic backups of `data/` directory

5. **Analytics**: Add analytics tracking (Google Analytics, etc.)

## Notes

- All navigation uses `.php` extensions but `.htaccess` should handle clean URLs
- If clean URLs don't work on Hostinger, check Apache mod_rewrite is enabled
- Tailwind CDN is used for simplicity; consider compiling for production if preferred
- JSON data storage works for small scale; consider database for larger scale
