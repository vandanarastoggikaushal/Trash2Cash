# Assets Directory

This directory should contain app icons and splash screens.

## Required Files (for production builds):

1. **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024 pixels)
   - Used for iOS App Store and Android Play Store
   - Should be a square image with your app logo

2. **splash.png** - Splash screen image (1242x2436 pixels for iOS)
   - Shown when app is launching
   - Currently using solid color background (#15803d)

3. **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 pixels)
   - Used for Android home screen icons

## For Development:

You can run the app without these files. They're only required when building for production.

## Creating Icons:

1. Design a 1024x1024 icon with your Trash2Cash logo
2. Save as `icon.png` in this directory
3. For Android, create `adaptive-icon.png` with the same dimensions
4. For splash screen, create `splash.png` with your branding

The app will work fine in development mode without these files.
