# Protect Diagnostics Folder
# This folder contains sensitive debugging tools
# Access should be restricted to authorized personnel only

# Option 1: Password Protection (Recommended)
# Uncomment the following lines and create .htpasswd file
# AuthType Basic
# AuthName "Diagnostics - Restricted Access"
# AuthUserFile /full/path/to/.htpasswd
# Require valid-user

# Option 2: IP Restriction (Alternative)
# Allow only specific IP addresses
# Replace with your IP address
# <RequireAll>
#     Require ip 127.0.0.1
#     Require ip YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
# </RequireAll>

# Option 3: Deny All Access (Most Secure)
# Uncomment to completely block access (you'll need FTP/SSH to access files)
# Order deny,allow
# Deny from all

# For now, we'll use a simple approach - require authentication
# You can set this up in Hostinger hPanel → File Manager → Password Protect Directory

# Prevent directory listing
